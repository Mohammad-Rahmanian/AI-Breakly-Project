# PACMAN AI

This is a project for the PACMAN AI course from the University of Berkeley. It contains four phases: search, multi agent, MDP and RL, and GhostBusters.

## Phase 1: Search

Files:
- search.py
- searchAgents.py
- util.py

Description:
- Implementations of DFS, BFS, UCS, A* search algorithms and heuristics
- Pacman will search through a maze to find food while avoiding ghosts

## Phase 2: Multi Agent

Files:
- multiAgents.py

Description:
- Implementation of reflex agent, minimax agent, alpha-beta pruning agent, and expectimax agent
- Pacman will compete against multiple ghosts in a game of capture-the-flag

## Phase 3: MDP and RL

Files:
- analysis.py
- qlearningAgents.py
- valueIterationAgents.py

Description:
- Implementation of value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning algorithms
- Pacman will learn to navigate a maze optimally and collect food while avoiding ghosts

## Phase 4: GhostBusters

Files:
- bustersAgents.py
- inference.py

Description:
- Implementation of exact inference using the forward algorithm and particle filtering
- Pacman will navigate through a dark maze and catch ghosts with a flashlight
