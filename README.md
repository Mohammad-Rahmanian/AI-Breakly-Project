# Pacman AI Project

This project focuses on three phases of Artificial Intelligence: Search Algorithms, Multi-Agent Systems, and Reinforcement Learning, applied to the classic Pacman game. Each phase explores different aspects of AI and aims to enhance Pacman's capabilities using various techniques.

## Phase 1: Search Algorithms

In this phase, we implement search algorithms to enable Pacman to find optimal paths and make intelligent decisions. The algorithms include depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search. By applying these algorithms, Pacman can navigate through the maze, avoiding obstacles, and reaching its goals effectively.

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Systems

The second phase involves developing a multi-agent system for Pacman, where Pacman interacts with ghosts and other agents within the game. We design communication protocols, decision-making mechanisms, and strategies for Pacman to coordinate its actions with the ghosts and achieve its objectives. This phase emphasizes the cooperation and competition aspects of Pacman's interactions with other agents.

## Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning

In the final phase, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to train Pacman to make optimal decisions based on rewards and punishments. We implement Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to enable Pacman to learn from its interactions with the game environment. Through trial and error, Pacman improves its performance and adapts its actions to achieve better outcomes.
