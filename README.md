# Artificial Intelligence Project

This project focuses on three phases of Artificial Intelligence: Search Algorithms, Multi-Agent Systems, and Reinforcement Learning. Each phase explores different aspects of AI and its applications in solving complex problems.

## Phase 1: Search Algorithms
In this phase, we implement various search algorithms such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search. These algorithms are used to find optimal paths and solutions in a given search space. The project includes implementations of the algorithms and provides visualization capabilities to observe their search progress.

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Systems
The second phase involves the development of multi-agent systems. We explore how multiple agents can interact and cooperate to achieve common goals. The project focuses on designing communication protocols, negotiation strategies, and decision-making mechanisms for the agents. The goal is to create intelligent agents that can effectively work together in dynamic environments.

## Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning
In the final phase, we delve into reinforcement learning techniques. Reinforcement learning enables an agent to learn optimal actions through trial and error. We implement algorithms such as Q-learning. The project includes training simulations, reward systems, and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the learned policies.
